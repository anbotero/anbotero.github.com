Wow, what can I say. It’s been a long journey. I’ve been working four years
trying to get my own Website on‐line, to no avail. There were obstacles
everywhere which would prevent me from doing so:

* Distraction.
* Commitment.
* Laziness.

Being able to devote yourself to something is a talent; I guess I lack it. But
I’ve really been pushing myself to do it. So here it is.

If all goes as planned (that is if I don’t **forget** all about this) I’ll be
sharing my experiences on programming‐related topics here. I’m a student at the
[Politécnico Grancolombiano][poli] in Colombia where I study Systems Engineering.

I started this blog in my lovely MacBook, so most of what I will reveal will be
tested on Mac OS X. I’ll probably make a post about setting up a Ruby on Rails
environment under Mac OS X *(wow, really, something never __ever__ seen before)*
when time’s right. I plan on documenting other interesting *(and maybe not so
interesting)* things I bump into while getting used to Mac OS X.

Keep in mind this is my personal space. While you will probably already know some
of the things I will document here, just let me be. It makes me happy, and who
knows, maybe one day I will write about something *you* didn’t know.

Have fun!

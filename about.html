        <h2>Colophon</h2>
        <p><strong>{{ site.domain }}</strong> serves as a personal platform to write about development, work, studies, and whatever else happens to strike my fancy.</p>
        <h3>Bread</h3>
        <p>On the technical side, what keeps pages and writings working together is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" rel="external">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby‐based static site generator, which makes it as easy as pie to actually write articles in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. The entire <a href="https://github.com/anbotero/anbotero.github.com">source for this site sits on GitHub</a>, and is open for inspection. If you find broken links or anything else you believe is a genuine error, please <a href="mailto:error@{{ site.domain }}">let me know</a>.</p>
        <p>Code‐wise, the Website is in valid (<em>as much as it can be</em>), strict, and semantic HTML5, styled with not‐so‐valid CSS3. I’ve tried to include the best <a href="http://schema.org/" rel="external">Schema</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/" rel="external">ARIA</a> authoring practices.</p>
        <p>This site is happily crafted with Sublime Text 2 in my lovely MacBook.</p>
        <h3>Butter</h3>
        <p>I’m no designer myself, so the only thing I could really try to tackle was <strong>simplicity</strong>. I had a hard time trying to design something that I liked. I wanted a minimalist yet elegant design that emphasized the text and avoided the usual clutter of sidebars and other paraphernalia found on most blogs…</p>
        <p>Okay, that’s what everyone would like to hear, but the truth is that I couldn’t get a sidebar working as I wanted, so I glued it all together and let it ﬂow. I’m also still trying to find a cool cross‐browser font. For some reason, <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Yanone+Kaffeesatz&amp;subset=latin" rel="external">my current font</a> only displays nicely with <code class="language-css">-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased</code>, which luckily Google Chrome uses by default. The site works just fine without it, but it certainly loses some appeal.</p>

        <p>This means that you are free to use my design and content provided you don’t try to pass it off as your own, and if you use it in any way, remember to release that product under a same license or similar. A simple link back to my site with an attribution would be nice. And if by any miraculous reason you happen to make money with content on this site, it would be really nice of you to teach me how you did it. I want to make money and be happy too.</p>
        <p>If you happen to use any of my code, let me know: it’d certainly be nice to catch up and compare approaches.</p>
